# Idena Wasm Binding

Go bindings and platform static libraries for the Idena smart-contract
runtime.

[![Test Idena-wasm-binding](https://github.com/ubiubi18/idena-wasm-binding/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ubiubi18/idena-wasm-binding/actions/workflows/main.yml)

> This repository is a versioned bridge between consensus-sensitive Rust and
> Go code. It has no independent binary release. Use the exact revision pinned
> by the consuming `idena-go` source, not an arbitrary branch snapshot.

The coordinated candidate revision and every native archive checksum are also
vendored in [`compatibility/stack-lock.json`](compatibility/stack-lock.json).
The compatibility workflow verifies that this lock, `ARTIFACTS_SOURCE`, and
`SHA256SUMS` describe one identical artifact set.

## Artifact provenance

The checked-in archives are built by the pinned `idena-wasm` GitHub workflow.
Their source revisions and toolchain are recorded in `lib/ARTIFACTS_SOURCE`,
and every file is covered by `lib/SHA256SUMS`.

The current artifact set contains:

- Linux x64 and ARM64
- macOS x64 and ARM64
- Windows x64

### What was updated

- The module and CI now use Go `1.26.5` on current Linux, macOS, and Windows
  runners.
- Static archives are imported only from a successful workflow with expected
  idena-wasm and Wasmer revisions and matching runner-produced checksums.
- Tests verify every checked-in archive against the local checksum manifest.
- Extracted binary strings are scanned for credentials and other secret-like
  material before the archives are accepted.
- Go formatting, vet, tests, and `govulncheck` run across the supported host
  matrix.

### Benefits

- Reproducible provenance for otherwise opaque native archives.
- Early detection of stale, substituted, corrupted, or credential-bearing
  artifacts.
- One reviewed ABI and runtime set shared by node, desktop, and contract tests.

### Risks and tradeoffs

- Checksums prove file identity, not correctness or absence of exploitable
  native code. The producing source and workflow still require review.
- The Go API, generated protobuf models, callbacks, and static archive must stay
  ABI-compatible. Updating only one side can cause crashes, memory corruption,
  or different contract execution.
- Archives cannot be reused across operating systems or architectures. Windows
  additionally depends on the expected GNU toolchain linkage.
- Binary secret scanning is heuristic. It reduces accidental leakage but cannot
  prove that an archive contains no sensitive or malicious data.

## Validate locally

Use Go `1.26.5` and the native toolchain for the host:

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go tool govulncheck ./...
scripts/check-wasm-artifact-secrets.sh
```

## Refresh artifacts

To refresh all supported platforms from a successful `idena-wasm` Build run:

```bash
scripts/update-wasm-artifacts.sh <workflow-run-id> <expected-idena-wasm-revision> <expected-wasmer-revision>
```

The importer requires the GitHub CLI, Cargo, and `jq`. It rejects unsuccessful
or unexpected revisions, verifies the pinned Wasmer source and each
runner-produced checksum before copying any archive, and regenerates the local
manifest. Commit the source record, checksums, and all archives together.

## Compatibility rule

Advance the runtime in this order: Wasmer fork, idena-wasm, binding artifacts,
then idena-go and desktop source manifests. Run smart-contract fixtures and the
full node suite before distributing the resulting node. Reversing or partially
applying that order creates an unreviewed runtime combination.
